    <h1>Hi and welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Simcha, and let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
    <p>My first real job was as a personal trainer. I did that for about five years, and in all honesty, I loved every minute of it. With my passion for training and the urge to help others, it never even felt like work. Even though I don’t officially train people anymore, whenever someone asks me for help with the gym, training, or dieting, I can never say no.</p>
    <p>After some hardships in life, I thought it was time to step away from the thing I loved so much. I went looking for something new and started working as a plumber. And as much as I learned from plumbing, it never felt like me, so after a while, I knew I needed a different direction.</p>
    <p>Having designed websites in the past for myself and others, I thought it might be a good idea to try web development and I absolutely fell in love. Every part of the process felt exhilarating, and putting together a website from scratch was euphoric and incredibly fulfilling.</p>
    <p>As of right now, my plan is to earn a certification as a full-stack web developer, and after that, continue learning more in programming and AI.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading, and I wish you a lot of success in life and in all your endeavors.</p>
